# Cotton-Disease-Prediction

In this Deep Learning project which is completely implemented using Google Colab, we acquire the dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/janmejaybhoi/cotton-disease-dataset )
we predict image of a cotton leaf/plant  is infected or not infected.

Algorithm used : Resnet50 (it is a image classification model with its weights pretained on Imagenet dataset)

Note: each Keras Application expects a specific kind of input preprocessing. For ResNet50, call tf.keras.applications.resnet.preprocess_input on your inputs before passing them to the model.
